# Portfolio - Deepak Lekhak

## Introduction 🙇🏻
Hello! My name is Deepak Lekhak, an enthusiastic engineer with a passion for mathematics and a strong desire to explore the world of computer science. In my opinon, a theory left unapplied, is a theory wasted. At the end of the day, theory will only take you so far.😉

## Bio 👨🏻‍💻
I am currently majoring in mathematics, and my journey in this field is driven by two primary motivations:

1. **Core Computer Science:** I have a keen interest in computer science, and I aspire to work as a software engineer or architect. To achieve this, I recognize that a strong foundation in mathematics is essential. It forms the backbone of many computer science concepts and is a valuable asset for any aspiring software engineer.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The world of AI fascinates me, and I believe that mathematics is the key to understanding and advancing in this field. The intricate algorithms, data analysis, and machine learning techniques that power AI systems often rely heavily on mathematical principles. By majoring in mathematics, I am setting a solid foundation for my future endeavors in AI.

## Academic Goals 🤓

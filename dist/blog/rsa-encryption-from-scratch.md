### Introduction

Most of us rely on cryptographic systems every day ‚Äî from messaging apps to online banking ‚Äî without thinking about what‚Äôs happening under the hood. As a developer passionate about system-level understanding, I decided to implement RSA encryption entirely from first principles in Java ‚Äî no external cryptographic libraries, just raw number theory and secure logic.

This post explains the mathematical foundation, key implementation steps, and a walkthrough of how I built `CryptIt.java`, my RSA encryption engine, with database integration for secure key storage.

### What is RSA?

RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It‚Äôs widely used for secure data transmission.

The security of RSA hinges on three mathematical principles:

1. **Prime factorization** is hard (especially with large numbers).
2. **Modular arithmetic** enables trapdoor functions ‚Äî easy one way, hard to reverse without a key.
3. **Euler's Theorem** provides the groundwork for the modular inverse that acts as the decryption key.

### The CryptIt Class: Overview

This class handles RSA key generation, encryption, decryption, and private key storage in a PostgreSQL database. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its core components:

### üîê Key Generation

```java
keyPair.p = generatePrime(random);
keyPair.q = generatePrime(random);
keyPair.modulus = p * q;
```

To begin, I generate two large, random primes `p` and `q` using Java‚Äôs `BigInteger` with the Miller-Rabin primality test. Their product, `n = p * q`, forms the modulus.

```java
keyPair.publicKey = new BigInteger("3");
```

For simplicity, I used a small fixed public exponent `e = 3`, which is acceptable for small-scale encryption (though `65537` is more typical in practice).

```java
keyPair.privateKey = LinDinEqSolve.myLDE(e, (p-1)(q-1));
```

I compute the modular inverse of `e` modulo œï(n) using my custom `myLDE()` method (Linear Diophantine Equation Solver), yielding the private key `d`.

### üßÆ Solving for the Private Key

RSA‚Äôs decryption key `d` must satisfy the condition:

```
e * d ‚â° 1 (mod (p-1)(q-1))
```

This is a classic modular inverse problem. I implemented it as:

```java
public static BigInteger myLDE(BigInteger e, BigInteger UppBound) {
    if (e.gcd(UppBound).equals(BigInteger.ONE)) {
        return e.modInverse(UppBound);
    }
    return null;
}
```

This ensures `e` is coprime to the totient and calculates the inverse safely.

### üßæ Database Integration

To simulate real-world key persistence, I integrated PostgreSQL for secure key storage. This means:

* If a key exists, it‚Äôs retrieved and reused.
* If not, a fresh keypair is generated and stored.

```java
ResultSet resultSet = db.executeSql("SELECT privateexp FROM keypair...");
```

This approach makes it easy to scale future builds with user-specific key management.

### üîê Encryption and Decryption

Here‚Äôs the beauty of RSA in action:

#### Encrypt:

```java
c = m^e mod n
```

Each byte of a message is encrypted separately:

```java
m = new BigInteger(String.valueOf(msgBytes[i]));
c = m.modPow(publicKey, modulus);
```

#### Decrypt:

```java
m = c^d mod n
```

And during decryption, each byte is restored:

```java
msgBytes[i] = msgBytes[i].modPow(privateKey, modulus);
```

Finally, we reassemble the decrypted message with `UTF-8` encoding.

### üß™ Sample Output

Running the sample in `Main.java`:

```java
Original Message: Hello World  
Encrypted Message: [146, 143, ...]  
Decrypted Message: Hello World  
```

### Lessons Learned

Building RSA from scratch gave me deep insight into:

* Modular arithmetic and cryptographic number theory.
* Database interaction for cryptographic persistence.
* Secure random prime generation and its edge cases.
* Handling encoding/decoding when working byte-wise with encryption.

This was not only an exercise in implementing cryptography but also in building a mini security system that combines Java, SQL, and mathematics.
